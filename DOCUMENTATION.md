# Functionalities added to the older version:
### Revamped and Intuitive UI
In the previous version, the UI was very basic and did not have origniality. We reworked the UI and added a menu button that closes and opens up a sidebar and contains all of our functinalities. Other than that, we removed the recommend task functionality as it did not recommend or schedule tasks and only viewed tasks in a random order.

### Friends
We added friends section, where you could see all your friends, add friends, view pending requests and approvals of friend requests and a framework to share your task history with your friends.

### Reworked Adding Task Functionality
We reworked adding task functionality and added 2 new and important features. First, associating your friends with task that the user is going to add. If the friend is associated, the task is also assigned to that friend and the task won't be fully completed until and unless all of the users, associated with the task, won't complete from their side. Second, we added "Start Time" and "End Time" fields that take in the time expected starting time and end time of the task. This functionality will be used in the newly added analytics section.

### Analytics Section
We have also analytics section about the tasks which helps user gain insights and make better decisions. We provide analytics by 4 different types of visualizations:
- 

### Improved Documentation
We generated the code documentation using a new format called Pycco. We also revamped the readme and other docs for better readability and user experience.
